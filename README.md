# Rasberrypi skyphotographing with AI identification for star formations

Final project for the Building AI course - photographing sky wiht rasberrypi with AI

## Summary

TO build working system that can sky photograph known star constellations, and by reconizing them by using AI which works with tensorflow lite. 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* limited computing power on rasberrypi 4
* knowledge for codebase
* resources and time for use in this project?


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

Material problem, only software

## What next?

Start coding and uploading coming versions.
