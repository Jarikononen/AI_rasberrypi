# Rasberrypi skyphotographing with AI identification for star formations

Final project for the Building AI course - photographing sky wiht rasberrypi with AI

## Summary

To build working system that can sky photograph known star constellations, and by reconizing them by using AI which works with tensorflow lite. 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* limited computing power on rasberrypi 4
* knowledge for codebase
* resources and time for use in this project?


## How is it used?

With Rasberrypi 4 machine/system and accessories i shall install this camera-system on summer to work outside location and by using AI i will regonize and hopely photograph star constellations automaticly.

## Data sources and AI methods
RIght now i don't have any data to show, but i will update the info which i will use in this project.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

Material problem, only software

## What next?

Start coding and uploading coming versions. 


## Acknowledgments

Coming soon.
